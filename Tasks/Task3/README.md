From the "Example for Task 3", the 5th version of the main implementation is selected (We will model the vertex with the
function of the same name. Thus, the code corresponding to the transition from the vertex will be localized in the body of the function, returning from the function corresponding to the current vertex, the address
corresponding to the next vertex of the function). \
The merge sorting algorithm is used for sorting. Moreover, when sorting, the words themselves are not copied or moved in memory, only the array of pointers to these words changes (as if only the arrows for these words change). \
The program is divided into 3 modules: working with the L-graph, sorting functions and the main module that operates the L-graph.
